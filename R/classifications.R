# Categorization of OSM Features by Functional Categories
# See: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features
# Developed to Minimize Overlap/Missclassification in Africa
#### -------------------------------------------------------


#' A Classification of OSM Features by Economic Function
#'
#' This classification, developed for Krantz (2023), aims to classify OSM features into meaningful and specific economic
#' categories such as 'education', 'health', 'tourism', 'financial', 'shopping', 'transport', 'communications',
#' 'industrial', 'residential', 'road', 'railway', 'pipeline', 'power', 'waterway' etc. Separate classifications
#' are developed for points and polygons (buildings) (33 categories), and lines (11 categories), which should be applied to
#' the respective layers of OSM PBF files, see \link{osmclass-package} for and example. The classification is optimized
#' (in terms of tag choice and order of categories) to assign the most sensible primary category to most features in the Africa OSM.
