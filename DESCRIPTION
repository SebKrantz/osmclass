Description: Functions to classify Open Street Map (OSM) features into meaningful functional 
    or analytical categories. Designed for OSM PBF files, e.g. from <https://download.geofabrik.de/> 
    imported as spatial data frames. A classification consists of a list of categories that are related to 
    certain OSM tags and values, also specified as a list. Given a layer from an OSM PBF file and a 
    classification, the main osm_classify() function returns a classification data table giving, 
    for each feature, the primary and alternative categories (if there is overlap) assigned, and the tag(s) 
    and value(s) matched on. The package also contains a classification of OSM features by 
    economic function, based on Krantz (2023) <https://ssrn.com/abstract=4537867>.
