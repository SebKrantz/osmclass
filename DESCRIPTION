Description: Functions to help classify Open Street Map (OSM) features into meaningful functional 
    or analytical categories. Designed for OSM PBF files, e.g. from <https://download.geofabrik.de/> 
    imported as spatial data frames using sf::st_read(). A classification consists of a list of categories 
    which are related to certain OSM tags and values - also specified as a list. Given a layer from an OSM 
    PBF file imported as spatial data and a classification, the main osm_classify() function returns a 
    classification data frame giving, for each feature, the primary and alternative categories (if there 
    is overlap), and the tag and value matched on. The package also contains a suggested classification of 
    point/polygon features into 33 economically meaningful categories, and of lines into 11 categories.
