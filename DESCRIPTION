Description: Classify Open Street Map (OSM) features into meaningful functional 
    or analytical categories. Designed for OSM PBF files, e.g. from <https://download.geofabrik.de/> 
    imported as spatial data frames. A classification consists of a list of categories that are related to 
    certain OSM tags and values. Given a layer from an OSM PBF file and a classification, the main 
    osm_classify() function returns a classification data table giving, for each feature, the primary and 
    alternative categories (if there is overlap) assigned, and the tag(s) and value(s) matched on. 
    The package also contains a classification of OSM features by economic function/significance, 
    following Krantz (2023) <https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=4537867>.
